A blockchain database is immutable and is cryptographically protected.
This article is on few very basic aspects of cryptography.
SHA-256 SHA-2 (Secure Hash Algorithm) is a set of cryptographic hash functions designed by United States NSA.
Key aspects of a hash function are :
 It is a one way function. From a known output value one cannot derive the input value.
 It mathematically converts the input to a standard sized output.</description>
